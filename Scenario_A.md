Hey John,

I hope this message finds you well.

We want to acknowledge your interest and efforts on submitting your prework for the Web Development program. 

Unfortunately, we regret to inform you that we cannot transfer you to the Advanced Track. While the first few topics are somewhat similar, each track has specific prerequisites to ensure the best learning experience. Based on the skills you have provided us during the application, it is best that you start with the Intermediate Track. We also want to avoid placing students in a track that's either too basic or to advanced. Following the track you qualify for is essential, as the pacing depends on the course level. 

We understand this decision may be disappointing, but please know that we have your best interests at heart. We hope you understand and continue with the Intermediate Track to maximize your learning experience.

All the best, <br>
**Jenner** <br>
CodePath.org Team

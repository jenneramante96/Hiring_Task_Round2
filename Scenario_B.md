Hi Jane,

Thank you so much for your enthusiasm for our courses. We are impressed with the effort you've put into your application.

Unfortunately, based on our current sponsorships, our courses are restricted to students enrolled in our partner universities within the United States. This information is included in the [eligibility section](https://placeholder.com) of the application form.

However, we look forward to expanding to other countries. We are currently running classes in Haiti and have previously offered classes in Taiwan.

Thank you for your understanding. Please feel free to reach out if you have any other concerns.


Best Regards, <br>

**Jenner** <br>

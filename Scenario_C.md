Hi Anne,

We appreciate your interest in our Summer Interview Prep course. However, we already have closed our admissions last **May 20, 2024**. 

We understood the eagerness you have showed since you will graduate also this Spring which makes you ineligible also in the future based on the [eligibility requirements](https://placehold.co/600x400) of this program. As much as we wanted to include you in our admission, the class is full and there are still more on our waitlist.

We would like to still support you in your journey. We hope you will find the following hepful:

* You may read on tips and guidelines that you might find helpful in our [high-level software interview guide](http://tinyurl.com/codepathinterviewguide).
* Also, please don't hesitate to access our [resources page](https://placehold.co/600x400) for helpful guides.
* Additionally, you can join in our [mailing list](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst) to get updates from us in case there are future courses or virtual events that you might be interested in. 

We hope for the best in your endeavors.

Warm Regards,<br>
**Jenner** <br>

Hi Dennis!

Thank you for reaching out. 

We have been reaching out to you via email with regards to your missing coursework. However, we haven't heard back from you in time. 

As what has been outlined in our [course policies](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/ios_university/policies_remote_fall19), missing even a single assignment will result in removal from the course. You know that timely and complete assignment submission is crucial to our educational model. 

Although you have been removed from the class, you still have lifetime access to the course material. This allows you to continue learning. Please use the github used during the application. 

We hope for the best of luck in you tech journey. 

Warm Regards, <br>

**Jenner** <br>
